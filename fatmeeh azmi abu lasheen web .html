                    <h2>Why Founders and Coders?!</h2>
					<p>Founders and Coders CIC is a UK-based nonprofit that develops and runs tuition-free, peer-led training programmes in web development, guided by our core values of cooperation, inclusion and social impact. I chose to apply for this programme cause when you experience a different culture you gain a deeper understanding of yourself and those around you deepening your knowledge about the world in a way that books, school assignments, and a professional career can never reveal. As an exchange participant you will develop leadership skills, self-confidence,building new friendships, taking responsibility for yourself, respecting differences, and tolerating the beliefs of others , I got really excited for the program after hearing about my friends experience and their advice to join </p>
